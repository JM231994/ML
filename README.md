# ML
Machine learning projects: 

Please find four jupyter notebooks: 

•	A regression study that seeks to find the best regression model to predict house prices in California. I covered Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest Regressor. 

•	A binary classification study that seeks to determine whether or not a tumour is benign or malignant.

•	A multi-class study that seeks to find the family of a wine. In both classification studies, I covered the Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, Naïve Bayes, SVM. 

•	A text mining study that seeks to compare documents against each other. I covered web-scraping and search retrieval codes. You will find a .pdf file with the results.

You will also find attached a .py and a .pdf file that fully handle a ML classification problem: 

•	A study that seeks to determine whether a person should have a loan approved (I used Hyper-parameter tuning and the Multi-Layer Perceptron model).
